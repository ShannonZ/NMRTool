# MRI
These programs are used for research in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. 

### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) simulation and analysis tools

Extract and analyze experimental parameters; generate experimental notes from NMR datasets; simulate NMR signal under chemical exchange, spin relaxation and electromagnetic wave; generate publishable figures using **matplot**, **numpy** and **scipy**; code in **python**and **MatLab**. This tool was used by dozens of scholars in this area for experiments design and validation, leading to 3 co-authored paper published in top journals including Journal of American Chemical Society.

### Control System of a chemical reactor

Control the reaction of hydrogen gas with drug solutions; regulate the pressure of the gas and the magnetic field of the reactor; synchronize the valves for transportation of the product solution; monitor the status of the instrument in real time; achieve 1400 times NMR signal enhancement through polarization; program in **C**.

### MRI database management

Integrate various source data into relational databases via ETL, and interact with **NoSQL**, **HDFS** databases; provide service recommendations using data analytics tools such as **Python** anaconda, and using machine-learning techniques such as Random Forests, SVM, Logistic Regression;

### Compressed Sensing MRI

Algorithm for under-sampling MRI acquisition and reconstruction using information theory; reduce acquisition time to 25% of standard procedure while keeping all the diagnostic information.

;zg for use with parahydrogen polariser version v3
;by default, the parahydrogen polarization experiments are performed in the following order
;1: user loads the sample to the mixing chamber by clicking the button "load"
;2: execute the pulse sequence
;   a. use parahydrgoen to polarize the sample for a specifit time,
;   b. then transfer the sample to the flowcell for NMR measurement;
;   c. apply pulses, gradients and delays, and measure a spectrum
;   d. transfer back the sample from the flowcell to the mixing chamber
;3: user empties the mixing chamber by clicking the button "Empty" or "Empty save sample"

;Transfer and Return of the sample using parahydrogen polariser version v3


;by default, the parahydrogen polarization experiments are performed in the following order
;1: user loads the sample to the mixing chamber by clicking the button "load"
;2: execute the pulse sequence
;   a. use parahydrgoen to polarize the sample for a specifit time,
;   b. then transfer the sample to the flowcell for NMR measurement;
;   c. apply pulses, gradients and delays, and measure a spectrum
;   d. transfer back the sample from the flowcell to the mixing chamber
;3: user empties the mixing chamber by clicking the button "Empty" or "Empty save sample"

;d1 : relaxation delay; set to very short for hyperpolarisation experiments 
;d40: delay for loading sample from the polariser to the flowcell
;d42: delay for returning sample from the flowcell to the polarizer
;d44: delay for emptying sample from the polarizer to  the vial
;d45: delay betweem scans
;l0 : accumulate L0 scans; re-polarising between scans
